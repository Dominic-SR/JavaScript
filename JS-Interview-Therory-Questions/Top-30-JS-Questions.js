2. what are templateliterals in JavaScript ?

template literals are what you get when you combine the dollar sign curly brackets and the back
ticks now the reason why we need them is to Simply make our coding lives easier let me tell you how if we have two
variables a with the value 10 and B with the value 20 and we want to print their
sum on the console it would look something like this this code is now not so clean and requires a lot of work
hence we use template literals they neatly enclose everything within back ticks with executable code placed inside
the dollar signs and curly braces like this so in a nutshell template literals are used to embed variables and
expressions directly into a string making the code more readable and flexible
